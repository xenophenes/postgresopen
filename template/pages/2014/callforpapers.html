                                <p>Of course, we're happy to receive proposals for talks on other PostgreSQL related topics as well.</p>

                                <p>We may also have a limited number of longer, 90-minute, slots available.
                                   Please indicate clearly in your submission if you wish to make a
                                   90-minute talk.
                                </p>

                                <p>Finally, there will be a session of five minute lightning talks. A separate call for proposals will be made for them further on.</p>
                                <p>The submission deadline is July 14th. Selected speakers will be notified before August 1st, 2014.</p>

                                <p>Please submit your proposals by going to <a href="/events/speakerprofile/pgopen2014/">the speaker profile form</a> and set up your speaker profile.
                                   If you have already spoken at a previous PGConf event, you may already have
                                   a profile - please take a minute to review it. Once you have a profile,
                                   this page will provide a link to a form where you can submit one or more
                                   talks for PostgresOpen 2014. When the site prompts for a login, use your
                                   regular postgresql.org community account.
                                </p>

                                <p>The proposals will be considered by committee who will produce a schedule to be published nearer the conference date.</p>

                                <p>All selected speakers will get free entry to the conference (excluding
                                   training sessions). We do not in general cover travel and accommodations
                                   for speakers, but may be able to do that in limited cases. If you require
                                   assistance with funding to be able to attend, please make a note of this
                                   in the submission notes field.
